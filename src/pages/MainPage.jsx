        <p>However, before you can convey the message to those in charge, a friend of yours, in order to save you, puts you in a time capsule. After a few seconds, you get transported to another space time to hide.</p>
        <p>Î¥ou have to find the passwords of the time capsule, using the cryptographic tools and methods of each time period and travel to the space time of each event, when it unfolds.</p>
        <p>Can you make it in time?</p>
